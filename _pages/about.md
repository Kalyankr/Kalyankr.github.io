## "Farmers are the Backbone"

I am very much concerned about farmers suicides in India, There was an steep increase in suicide commits by farmers day by day in recent times due to lack of help from government, agriculture debit, market price reduction and many more. Coming from a farmers family I know how hard for a farmer in India to make living and how his efforts are not valued in the market. Farmers quitting farming took an exponential way. As per the recent survey by [CSDS](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/indias-deepening-farm-crisis-76-farmers-want-to-give-up-farming-shows-study-43728) 76% of the farmers want to quit farming in the world largest farms products country.

"The Day We live, the Day belong to Farmer and Soldier."

If anybody want to start programs or NGO to help farmers or have an existing one, please let me know, I will be glad to be with you and together we can work to change the lives at least 0.001%.

I am also a member of great NGO [Aasya](http://www.aasyafoundation.org/) supporting to financially unstable families whose children suffering from Cancer.
Want to see a child smiling without cancer, We believe in " A single twig break but bunch of twigs are strong", We are waiting for more hands to join with us, each and every hand is welcome to help by volunteering, donating, sponsoring.
For donating please visit [link](http://www.aasyafoundation.org/contact.html) and reach out to the corresponding head.

Respect Farmers.
