## Resampling methods

### Want to learn statistical resmapling methods.

Resampling helps you use the available data and make the models more generalized in statistical way. Can learn how effectively the fitted models works.
The resampling is done to improve accuracy of model. There are different ways of resampling of data like bootstrapping, cross-validation, repeated cross-validation etc. Re-sampling is a series of methods used to reconstruct your sample data sets, including training sets and validation sets.
